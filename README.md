# LogicalCalculator
--------------Assumption on the user analysis of the program-----------------

It is assume that the user want a program that do a logical computation of integer values for any giving expression
It is also assume that the user wishes to enter base ten numbers instead of binary numbers
The only acceptable logical computation are and(&), or(|), complement(~) and exclusive or(^)
The order of priority for compuation are:
1. Paranthesis()
2. complement(~)
3. and(&)
4. exclusive or(^)
5. or(|)
